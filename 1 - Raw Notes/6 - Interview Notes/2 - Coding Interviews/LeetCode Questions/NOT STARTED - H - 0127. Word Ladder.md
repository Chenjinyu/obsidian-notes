# Problem
A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
- `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or_ `0` _if no such sequence exists._

**Example 1:**
**Input:** beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `beginWord != endWord`
- All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.

# Step 1 - Understand the problem (10 mins)
- What are the input and output
- What are the edge cases? create your own examples
- What constraints matter?

1. Allow duplicate?
2. Allow Negative numbers?
3. Allow Empty List

## How do you think about this problem?
## Can you find out the exit condition? 
## What is the solution pattern? and why

# Step 2 - Try Brute Force First to help you understand the structure of the problems
```python
